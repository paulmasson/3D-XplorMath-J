<h2>3D-XplorMath-J Source Code</h2>
<p>The <i>vmm</i> directory contains the Java source code for
3D-XplorMath-J, a program for visualizing and experimenting with
a variety of mathematical objects or "exhibits."  The Web site for this program
can be found at <a href="http://3d-xplormath.org/j/index.html">http://3d-xplormath.org/j</a>.
3D-XplorMath-J is a Java version of 3D-XplorMath, a program for
Macintosh computers that has been around for several decades.
See <a href="http://3d-xplormath.org">http://3d-xplormath.org</a>.</p>
